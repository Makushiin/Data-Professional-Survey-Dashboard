## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

### **Dataset:**
The dataset consists of survey responses from **630 individuals** in the tech industry, covering various aspects of their careers and experiences.

### **Key Insights:**
- Distribution of respondents by **country**
- **Favorite programming languages**
- **Work/life balance satisfaction** levels
- **Salary satisfaction**
- Perceived **difficulty of breaking into tech**
- **Average age** of survey respondents

### **Techniques Used:**
âœ… **Power Query**: Data cleaning, column transformations, and handling missing values
âœ… **Data Modeling**: Creating relationships and defining cardinality
âœ… **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Custom calculations for insights
âœ… **Interactive Filtering**: Country-based filtering for dynamic visual updates

### **Visualizations Included:**
ðŸ“Œ **Stacked Bar Chart** - Average salary vs. job title  
ðŸ“Œ **Stacked Column Chart** - Favorite programming language distribution  
ðŸ“Œ **Treemap** - Country-wise survey distribution (interactive filter)  
ðŸ“Œ **Gauges** - Work/life balance and salary satisfaction  
ðŸ“Œ **Pie Chart** - Difficulty of breaking into tech  

## ðŸ”„ Data Transformation Steps
- **Removed blank columns** (e.g., browser and referrer columns)
- **Grouped â€˜Otherâ€™ job titles** into a single category
- **Split columns by delimiter** for multi-response questions (e.g., favorite programming language)
- **Processed salary data**: Extracted numeric values, removed symbols, and calculated salary averages
- **Reformatted country and industry columns** for consistency
- **Applied visual adjustments**: Changed color theme, arranged visuals for clarity

## ðŸš€ How to Use This Repository
1. **Download the `Data Survey.xlsx` file** if you want to explore the raw data.
2. **Open the `Data Survey Dashboard.pbix` file** in Power BI to interact with the dashboard.
3. **View `Data Survey Dashboard.pdf`** for a quick look at the final dashboard.
